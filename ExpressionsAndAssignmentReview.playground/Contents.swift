/* Imagine you are creating an app for counting calories called My Daily Calories. First lets set up what a constant for how many calories you will consumer a day at 2000
 and name this constant caloriesGoal. */

/* Next you will set up a variable for caloriesIn and set it to 0. You will burn calories during the day, so set up another variable for caloriesOut and set it to 0. */


/* You have just eaten breakfast so let an operator to add 300 calories to caloriesIn. But you have also just gone for a morning run, so you another operator to take out 100 calories. Print your results after each line. */




/* Lets update those calories with a compound assignment and add 300 calories to caloriesIn for your lunch. Print your results. */


/* We added another feature to My Daily Calories to track the amount of water consumed by the user. Lets set up a variable for waterTracker. Set the value to 0. */

/* Now add 20.4 oz of water to waterTracker using an operator. */

/* Did the above task compile? If not, update the waterTracker to a double using a conversion while adding the 20.4 oz of water. */
